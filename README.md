Rating: 3.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Meh
Date: Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 10, 2020
Review: This book is okay.

I always wondered why Ann Rule's book was a NYT Bestseller and so popular, while this book basically was collecting dust and relatively unheard of. Ann Rule was definitely NOT the definite source on Ted Bundy. Although she inflated her relationship to sell her book, logic tells the commonsense reader that she really did not have the sort of relationship with Bundy that she tries to portray in her book. For example, they only really had any interaction while he worked at the crisis center for one semester, and it was really only once a week that they even worked together, and she was 10 years older too and hardly attractive at all... yet, her novel portrays herself as something of a BFF to Bundy. She's clearly not. As a matter of fact, she actually got sued because of one of her novels (Heart Full of Lies), and she basically admitted that she hadn't interviewed anyone or did any actual research for that novel. Yet, she's a great writer though, and is a great storyteller.

The same can't be said about Kendall/Kloepfer. I feel like she's really trying to milk it, you know. First, the Netflix movie based on the book, which basically bought this book back into print (the original version was out of print for years before this second edition came out), and now the Prime series documentary to compete with the Netflix docu-series. I mean, really.

See, in Bundy's death-row interviews with journalists Michaud and Aynesworth, they didn't write a novel, they basically transcribed their tape recordings and made it into a book. Then Netflix made a docu-series based on those recordings. With Rule, they also made a 2003 movie on her book (it's available on Prime to stream), but there was a first movie based on her book, The Deliberate Stranger (starring Mark Harmon, in 1986).

That's why I feel like Kendall/Kloepfer is trying to milk it. I don't know, maybe she's got money problems or something, who knows?

The book is hardcover with a jacket and thread binding. The jacket is made out of quality paper. The book itself is a short read, you can finish it in one afternoon if you really want to. Print is a good size font, I'd said it's a standard 12-size Times New Roman font (or something similar to it). Chapters are really short though. She's just not a good storyteller. There's lots of colored pictures though, and it's printed on glossy brochure-type paper. The back flap of the jacket has a recent picture of her and her daughter... they're both matching peroxide blondes, and Molly (the daughter) looks like she's gotten quite a lot of facial surgeries done (she could be on one of the Bravo shows, The Real Housewives of LA or something).

She gives like a few short paragraphs about how she ended up as a single mother. I got the feeling she wasn't being completely honest and was trying to present herself in the best light. I mean, we all do that though, so it's understandable. Also, she seemed like a very neglectful mother too. I'm sure if it was today's era, she'd have Child Services called on her. For example, she wrote she often had Molly's grandmothers babysat. She had her young daughter sleeping on the couch instead of in the bedroom with her... my daughter is ten and she occasionally still sleeps in bed with me. So I can't understand why she'd make her very young child sleep on a couch.

Within the second chapter she invited a man (Bundy) home from the bar, but instead of just owning up to her promiscuity and admitting she didn't have the best parenting skills or motherly affection, she tries way too hard to convince the reader that was something she's never done. Yet she ends the chapter with worrying if Bundy saw her birth control pills. OK, this is the early 70's, BC was prescribed back then just for contraception. I know that now doctors prescribe it for other hormonal reasons, but they didn't do that back in the 70's. Really, it was only in the 90's that BC started being used for other reasons beside contraception... so why can't she just say that she was young, still in her 20s, and wanted to be a bit risque. I mean, we've all felt that way at one time or another, but her trying to adjust the narrative in her favor makes me regard the whole book with skepticism like I did with Rule's.

Also, within the first few chapters, she basically dumps her young daughter at "daycare". She says daycare, but I'm doubtful. She goes drinking at a bar (the night she met Bundy), and some guy at her friend Angie's suggests a babysitter for Molly so they can go drinking! Who's this babysitter at nighttime?! I mean, you can excuse Bundy going with her to pick up Molly at the sitter's, her driving drunk, and letting Bundy stay overnight because she was intoxicated... but that other part happened BEFORE they went to the bar.

Forward to the following chapter, she states that Angie wouldn't be able to watch Molly for the weekend so she could go to Vancouver with Bundy, but that Angie said her roommates would be able to. Like, WTF!?

BTW, Diane Edwards (AKA Stephanie Brooks) was the woman that everyone thought Bundy was targeting his victims after... NOT Kendall/Kloepfer. Edwards was the woman who broke his heart, and who made Bundy basically excel in life to win her back so he can dump her (Google her if you need to). He was also engaged to Edwards while he was dating Kendall/Kloepfer (although the engagement was probably a sham to just eventually break up with her)... and by all accounts, it was after Edwards dumped him that the attacks and murders started happening.

I'm waiting for either Bundy's ex-wife, daughter, or Diane Edwards to finally get a piece of the pie and write their own book about Bundy. Those three are the ones I'm most interested in, especially Edwards. She knew him before he became a serial killer, and most journalists and law enforcement agents, and Bundy-fans all agree that she's the reason he targeted the women that he did.

It's an okay read. I liked Rule's book better, and this is definitely no Truman Capote's In Cold Blood either. Three stars... something I would borrow from the library and enjoy, but am regretful that I spent the money to buy.

Title: seems to have been with the author of this book.
Date: Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 27, 2021
Review: Elizabeth Kendall is the pseudonym used by the woman who fell in love with him in 1969. It was mutual and it happened quickly. This story has the ring of truth and the author is quite open in revealing the way intimacy began and grew. She doesn’t hesitate to report what she views as her own flaws as well as his. In spite of his comings and goings, they were physically close - living together in a way - but they maintained separate residences. By the time he begins to abduct young high profile and high risk women, who are in their normal lives and disappear without a trace, he and Elizabeth have been together for 5 or 6 years. There are clues that he has problems that lead her to call the police after the 3rd and 4th girl disappear and he is witnessed by more than one person who produce a drawing that has some similarity to him (not really recognized by her - or me) - but she is uneasy about him for good reason - multiple good reasons but small ones compared to what is found out about what happened to those young women. Her calls to report her fears to the police and give them his name haunt her for the many years and for the arrest that follows. I read this book twice to catch the tone of this relationship. There are hints to a dangerous undertone, but more visible after years into the relationship. She is the closest he comes to revealing what is running through him in secret that emerges in the violence. He is walled off from guilt, but not from suffering, especially his own. She is haunted about having called the police and always questions herself / did he really do this? Did she create the reason they are relentless about him?
Ultimately she breaks off the relationship. Yet it is to her he turns to reveal his identity to the Florida police if they will allow him to call her. She wrote the first edition of this book while she was in early treatment for a problem with alcohol. It was a large part of their relationship from the beginning. In the later edition, she has been years without alcohol. At this point she views herself from the earlier book with regret that she felt she would always have a mutual connection with him. She has moved to the position of the general public - a sadistic serial killer who is basically a monster. She will allow herself no shred of what she felt for him. This was the one part that did not ring true. She wasn’t lying, but the hatred and disgust engendered in the public and the relatives of the women he killed put her in the position of Patty Hearst. They had to behave as they did to survive.
I think she does not give herself credit for having been the probable cause of why he went on that final spree and let himself get caught. He wanted that life with her, but he knew he couldn’t stop.
If all you feel about this guy is “yuck”, you probably won’t find this book appealing.

Title: Unique Perspective
Date: Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 28, 2022
Review: 90% of this book reads like the diary of a co-dependent, possibly mentally ill, teenage girl who is obsessed with a guy who likes her well enough, but just isn’t that into her. Makes me wonder what lurks in Liz’s origin family to have created such an insecure person ripe for targeting by a master manipulator like Ted Bundy. You’re reading along just shaking your head and saying WTH was she even thinking (for instance, joking about the police stakeout and pursuit of she and Ted when he was at her home) for the vast majority of the book. But what makes it a 4 star book instead of a 2 is that she was on the inside, and relates him from a perspective nobody else has. That, with the afterward written by a much healthier (mentally) woman, along with Molly’s story and the photos, makes the book worth reading. It made a deep impression on me in the end. I agree with Molly; they were lucky to be alive. And lest anyone judge, NOBODY has ever been in quite the unique circumstances these two women have been involved in. I can’t imagine how they feel. Powerful stuff here. It’s almost like Ted was possessed by another, evil entity. How on earth he could do the things he did and maintain a facade of normalcy with Liz and Molly boggles the mind. Thankfully, she DID report him and they live through their relationship with this vicious Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde. Recommend for people interested in the case.
